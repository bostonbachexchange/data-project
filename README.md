# GeoPandas Project README

## Overview
This project involves working with geospatial data using GeoPandas, a Python library that facilitates manipulation and analysis of geospatial data.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install GeoPandas and its dependencies using pip:

pip install geopandas


2. **Reading Data**: If you have a .tab file containing geospatial data, you can use GeoPandas to read it. Make sure your file is correctly formatted and contains spatial data. If you're unsure, you can first try reading it with Pandas to check its structure.

```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Specify the path to your .tab file
file_path = "1976-2022-house.tab"

# Read the .tab file using GeoPandas
data = gpd.read_file(file_path, sep='\t')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())
